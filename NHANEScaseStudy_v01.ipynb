    "# NHANES Case study: \n",
    "We will use this example to show the functionality of the Rcupcake package when both, exposure and phenotype variables are present in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) project of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been one of the most impactful public health research projects of US. It has direct relevance to nutrition, pediatric growth, environmental exposures and even genetic components of health risk. NHANES comprises measurements over 41,474 individuals whore are selected to be demographically representative by CDC-sponsored researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Goal\n",
    "Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are environmental pollutants that are detectable in the serum.  PCB 153 has the highest serum level among the PCBs. According to epidemiological studies, PCBs are known to be associated with different disorders. The goal of this study is to analyze whether different phenotype variables and phenotype co-occurrence are associated with PCB153 exposure. More specifically, we will answer the following questions:\n",
    "   1. How can we query NHANES data through the BD2K PIC-SURE API RESTful API using R?\n",
    "   2. What are the main demographic characteristics of our study population?\n",
    "   3. What are the main phenotypic characteristics of our study population?\n",
    "   4. Are the phenotype variables statistically associated with PCB153 exposure?\n",
    "   5. What are the phenotype co-occurrences of patients with PCB153 exposure?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Rcupcake` package\n",
    "The Rcupcake package enables the user to:\n",
    "   1. Query through BD2K PIC-SURE RESTful API\n",
    "   2. Explore the data from a demographic point of view\n",
    "   3. Analyze the phenotype variables according to their different values, in terms of prevalence and co-occurrence\n",
    "   4. Perform univariate analyses. \n",
    "   5. Describe the phenotype co-occurrence according to the patient exposure, such as PCB153 exposure\n",

    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
