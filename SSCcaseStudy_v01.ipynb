    "# Rcupcake: Case study on Simon Simplex Collection database\n",
    "We will use this example to show the functionality of the Rcupcake package when both, genotype and phenotype variables are present in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Nowadays, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children, being one of the fastest-growing developmental disabilities. Autism has been associated with a wide range of disorders, and many genes are related to it. However, the nature and extent of the comorbidities of autism at the population level need to be determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simon Simplex Collection (SSC) is an autism dataset that contains 2600 simplex families with one proband who has been diagnosed with autism, while the father, the mother and a sibling has not. All information collected during two years have been integrated in one giant system gathering genetic and clinical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rcupcake package allows retrieving the SSC data for a set of phenotypes regarding the presence or not of at least one de novo mutation in a specific gene. In this case study, we will describe how to analyze a set of phenotypes regarding one specific gene; the CHD8 gene (Binary variable: at least one de novo mutation in the gene CHD8). The phenotypes of interest for this case study will be, the head circumference, known to be associated with de novo mutations in CHD8 gene, and loss of language, facial expression and compulsions rituals (known to be associated with ASD). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Goal\n",
    "The goal of the study is to investigate whether different phenotypes variables and phenotype co-occurrences are associated with de novo mutation in CHD8 gene. More specifically, we will answer the following questions:\n",
    "1. How can we query SSC data through the BD2K PIC-SURE API RESTful API using R?\n",
    "2. What are the main demographic characteristics of our study population?\n",
    "3. What are the main phenotypic characteristics of our study population?\n",
    "4. Are the phenotype variables statistically associated with CHD8 mutation\n",
    "5. What are the phenotype co-occurrences of patients with de novo CHD8 mutation?\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rcupcake package\n",
    "The Rcupcake package enables the user to:\n",
    "1. Query through BD2K PIC-SURE RESTful API\n",
    "2. Explore the data from a demographic point of view\n",
    "3. Analyze the phenotype variables according to their different values, in terms of prevalence and co-occurrence\n",
    "4. Perform univariate analyses\n",
    "5. Describe the phenotype co-occurrence according to the patient exposure, such as having or not one de novo mutation in a specific gene.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Installation\n",
